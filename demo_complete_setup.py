Elara Moonwhisper stands tall among the ancient trees of Rivendell, her emerald eyes 
scanning the horizon for signs of danger. As a ranger of the Eldar, she has sworn to 
protect the innocent and fight against the encroaching darkness. Her chaotic good nature 
leads her to sometimes bend the rules in favor of what's right rather than what's lawful.

Born under the light of the full moon, Elara possesses an innate connection to nature 
and the ability to communicate with forest creatures. Her silver-threaded cloak bears 
the mark of her house, and her enchanted bow has never missed its target when justice 
is the cause. Though she appears young by elven standards at only 200 years old, her 
wisdom and experience rival those of much older beings.

Recent events have drawn her away from the peaceful valleys of Rivendell toward the 
darker corners of Middle-earth, where her skills as both warrior and diplomat will 
be tested to their limits.
